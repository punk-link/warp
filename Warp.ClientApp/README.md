# ClientApp

This folder hosts the Vue 3 + Vite Single Page Application mounted under /app.

Notes
- Created as part of Phase 2 (Project layout) of the Vue integration roadmap.
- Existing Razor Pages assets and Vite build for wwwroot/js remain unchanged.
- In Phase 3 we will scaffold the Vue app here and configure Yarn and SpaProxy.
