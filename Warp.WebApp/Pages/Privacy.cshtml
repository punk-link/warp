            Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details
            (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information
            about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social
            media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as
            well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

        <p>
            We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that

        <p>
            In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is

            request.
        </p>
        <h4>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</h4>
        <p>
            We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.
        </p>
        <h4>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
            We do not process consumer's sensitive personal information.
        </p>
        <h4>Verification process</h4>
        <p>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about
            whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
            information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance,
            depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can
            match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you
            through a communication method (e.g. , phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also
            use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make
            the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
            purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained
            by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity
            and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon
            as we finish verifying you.
        </p>

                restrict the processing of the information.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a
                request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to
                act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
            </li>
            <li>

                later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.
