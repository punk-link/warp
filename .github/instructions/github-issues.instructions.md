# How to Write GitHub Issues for the Warp Project

When creating GitHub issues for the Warp project, follow these guidelines to ensure they are clear, actionable, and facilitate efficient resolution:


### Issue Structure

```md
## Issue Title
[Brief, specific description of the problem or feature request]


### Description
Clear explanation of the issue or feature request.


### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to [page]
2. Click on [element]
3. Observe [behavior]


### Expected Behavior
What should happen.


### Actual Behavior
What actually happens.


### Screenshots
[Attach relevant screenshots showing the issue]


### Additional Context
Any other relevant information.
```


## Best Practices

1. Be Specific and Concise
    * Write clear titles that summarize the issue in a few words
    * Use technical terminology appropriate for the Warp project
2. Provide Complete Information
    * Include all steps necessary to reproduce the issue
    * Specify which part of the application is affected (Preview page, editor, etc.)
3. Use Markdown Formatting
    * Format code snippets with appropriate syntax highlighting
    * Use lists, headers, and quotes for readability
4. One Issue Per Report
    * Keep each issue focused on a single problem or feature
    * Create separate issues if you identify multiple problems
5. Reference Related Issues
    * Link to related issues with #[issue-number]
    * Mention if this issue blocks or depends on other work
6. Add Appropriate Labels
    * Tag with bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.
    * Indicate priority if applicable


## Rules

1. Return the issue as a formatted markdown. Do not add anithing, except the issue to the answer.
2. Include the Screenshots section only then a user provides screenshots.
